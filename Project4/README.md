A few notes:

- The project JAR file is Compiler.JAR, located in the root of the Project4 folder.
- My test files are located in the 'test' folder. There are 2 test files: succeeding tests (no errors, possibly some warnings) and failed tests (errors and/or warnings).
- There a few known issues (i.e. things I slaved over trying to figure out, but just could not). Instead of just having the program error out or produce a wrong executable image, I chose to just not support some things and have code gen fail if these unsupported things are attempted. I have test cases for these failures in the fails.in file.
