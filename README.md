# VanAllen-Compilers

This repository contains all of the code, documentation, and resources for my assignments in CMPT 432.

## Build and Deployment Documentation

Java will be my language of choice for this semester. I will be using the IntelliJ IDEA with JDK 8.

The following steps will guide you through recreating my development environment to ensure that you can properly compile and build my code. I am using a Mac, so all directions will be specifically for the Mac platform. Setup may slightly differ on other platforms.

### Installing JDK 8

1. Go to the Oracle download page for JDK at the following URL: https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html
2. Accept the License Agreement.
3. Find the right version for your machine (I am running on macOS) and click the download link.
4. Wait for the download to finish, then click the file to open it.
5. The JDK 8 Update window will popup. Double-click the box icon to run the installer.
6. Follow the instructions to finish the installation.

### Installing IntelliJ

I am using the Ultimate edition (on a free trial) and these instructions refer to installing that edition, but the Community edition is sufficient for the purposes of this class if you choose to use that instead.

1. Go to the IntelliJ IDEA download page at the following URL: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=mac
2. Ensure you have the right platform selected and click the download button for Ultimate.
3. After the download finishes, click the file to open it.
4. Following the instructions in the popup window, dragging the IntelliJ icon to your Applications folder.
5. Once the files finish copying over, navigate to your Applications folder and open IntelliJ IDEA.
6. You may get a warning that asks you if you're sure you want to open the app, click Open.
7. A window will appear that allows you to walk through personalizing your IntelliJ IDEA. You may choose to do so, or just click the button in the bottom left corner to use the default settings.
8. After finishing the personalization settings, you will be presented with a window that asks you activate your license or evaluate the Ultimate edition for free. You may choose to do either (If you create a JetBrains account with a .edu email address, you have full access to the Ultimate edition for free).
9. Once you activate your license or register for the evaluation trial, you are now ready to use IntelliJ.

### Running my projects in IntelliJ

1. Clone the project repository to your machine. (Pull the latest changes if you've already done this)
2. Open IntelliJ, and select Open on the welcome screen. (If the full IDE is open, go to File > Open)
3. Navigate to the repository, select the root folder of the project, and click Open.
4. Run the project by selecting Run > Run '<class name>'.
  
If a project requires more specific instructions, I will add a .txt file in the root folder of the project that explain the extra or alternate steps.
