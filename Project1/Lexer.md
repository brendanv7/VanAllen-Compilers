Nothing too crazy for the first project, just a few notes to help if you get lost.

1. The project JAR file is Lexer.JAR, located in the root of the Project1 folder.
2. My test files are located in the 'test' folder. There are 3 kinds of tests for this project: succeeding tests (no errors or warnings), failed tests (errors and/or warnings), and 1 empty file, which is a special case failure test.
