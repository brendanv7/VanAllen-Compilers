Same business as project 1.

1. The project JAR file is Compiler.JAR, located in the root of the Project2 folder.
2. My test files are located in the 'test' folder. There are 3 test files: succeeding tests (no errors or warnings), failed tests (errors and/or warnings), and 1 file that contains your test cases from the project instructions.
