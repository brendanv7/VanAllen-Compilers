Same business as projects 1 & 2.

1. The project JAR file is Compiler.JAR, located in the root of the Project3 folder.
2. My test files are located in the 'test' folder. There are 3 test files: succeeding tests (no errors, but some warnings), failed tests (errors and/or warnings), and 1 file that contains your test cases from the project instructions.
